# AdventOfCode_2018
This Repo contains my 2018 Advent of Code solutions.  Each folder corresponds with a given days problems and will contain any associated input files.

Each `.hs` file is a self-contained stack script for the solution.  Download and install [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) and then run the file with the command `stack example.hs`. This should bootstrap a GHCI install and download any library dependancies automatically.
